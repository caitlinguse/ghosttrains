  "Title": "JR Booth",
  "Information": "J.R. Booth was a remarkable man for many reasons, including his longevity, his wealth, his independence and his bold and innovative approach to business. Booth had the largest business in the British Commonwealth run by one man when he finally incorporated in 1921 at the age of ninety-four. He died in 1925 in his ninety-ninth year. His first big break came when he got the contract to provide the timber for the parliament buildings in Ottawa. His second break came when he acquired, at a very reasonable price, 250 square miles of prime pine in Algonquin Park from what was the estate of the early square timber baron John Egan but which had gone back to the crown. Booth harvested his Egan property for fifty years, often going there in his private rail car, and working with his men during the day and on business most of the night. He seldom slept for more than a few hours. ",

  "Title": "JR Booth",
  "Information": "As a natural extension of milling, Booth’s operations had grown to include a far-reaching transportation network. His involvement with forming and financing the Canada Atlantic Railway in 1879 [see Donald Alexander Macdonald* (Sandfield); William Goodhue Perley*] had drawn him into construction when the original proponents were unable to complete the project. He embraced this new phase of his career with enthusiasm. Railways offered his lumber business three major advantages: reduced labour costs on timber drives, freedom from the seasonal constraints on shipping, and speed. In 1882 Booth completed the 136-mile linkage of the CAR between Ottawa and Coteau-Landing on the St Lawrence, from which point the line eventually secured access to the Central Vermont; initially, the crossing had to be done by barge, but in 1890 this interruption was eliminated by the opening of a railway bridge across the river. To link the pinelands of Georgian Bay, his own upper limits, and the Ottawa River, Booth had started in 1884–86 with a small railway connecting lakes Nipissing and Nosbonsing. Next, the Ottawa, Arnprior and Renfrew and Ottawa and Parry Sound railways were chartered in 1888 and amalgamated in 1891 as the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, which was built in 1892–96. During construction, in 1893 Booth successfully disputed the rights to a strategically important pass near Wilno, which the rival Canadian Pacific had also claimed, and he sought to influence the southern boundary of the newly created Algonquin Park [see Aubrey White*] to avoid conflict with his line. (In the end, it ran through the park and Booth secured limits there.) Apart from the advantage the OAPS offered Booth in the lumber trade, for others the route cut 800 miles off the journey from Chicago to Montreal, with mile-a-minute service along the Ottawa-Montreal segment. To secure even more traffic, especially grain, Booth established elevators at Depot Harbour near Parry Sound, as well as at Duluth, Milwaukee, and Coteau-Landing. He eventually added a small fleet of ships to what was recognized as the largest privately owned railway in the world. The OAPS was merged in 1899 into the Canada Atlantic, and in 1904 Booth sold it for $14 million to the Grand Trunk, which he served as a director until it became part of the Canadian National system.",

  "Title": "JR Booth",
  "Information": "By the time he was in his nineties, Booth had achieved a reputation of legendary proportions tinged with the romance of the northern woods, even though by 1919 his production was being eclipsed by W. C. Edwards and Company Limited and others. On 27 March 1920, in a rare public appearance and to a “rousing ovation,” Booth dropped the puck for a Stanley Cup match between the Ottawa Senators and the Seattle Metropolitans. Within the timber industry he received plaudits as honorary president of the Canadian Lumbermen’s Association. Booth’s achievements inspired C. C. Jenkins to describe him in 1922 as one of those “men who have transformed the dreamy melody of the living waters into a roaring chant of commercial conquest.” In the words of Michael Grattan O’Leary* in the Evening Journal in 1925, the Booth to remember was “not the great magnate whose wealth is the envy of many and the wonder of more; but the great pioneer, the man whose genius and imagination tamed the wilderness . . . and, above all, did more than any man of his time to build up this Ottawa Valley.” On the occasion of his death in December 1925, following two months of confinement at his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King* generously referred to him as “one of the fathers of Canada.” Buried beside his wife in Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa, Booth was survived by his sons Jackson and John Frederick and his daughter Helen Gertrude Fleck.",

The weakened trestle was never replaced and no through traffic occurred after 1933. Trains continued as far as Highland Inn at Cache Lake from the east and into Algonquin Park from the west until 1959. The last scheduled train over the Ottawa to Whitney section, using diesel locomotives, was in 1959, although several excursion trains ran into the mid-1970s.

In addition he offered two acres of free land for the station grounds. However, J.R. Booth had the standard style Barry’s Bay railway station built practically in the middle of the Opeongo Road and much closer to Stafford’s general store rather than on the plot originally offered. Initially there was a baggage and freight shed attached to the station on the west side of the building. The shed was removed during renovations. ",

The construction of the entire OA&PS line from Ottawa to Depot Harbour on Georgian Bay took 5 1/2 years and was completed between 1892 and 1897. The first through-train ran over the railroad system on January 7, 1897. At the height of the railway’s prosperity there was enough traffic to require one train to pass through every twenty minutes over its single-track line.",
